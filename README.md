### Hi there 👋
I am currently a manager of a city centre cocktail bar, regularly creating new and interesting cocktail recipes.
I have worked in hospitality for over 10 years.

I am studying data science and analytics to help me be able to change careers to one that will allow me to work remotely so I can move to Spain and travel the world.

I am currently learning Python and SQL.

I love the hospitality and drinks industries and am interested to see how data science is used in them.
